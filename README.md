# Machine Learning and the Hall of Fame
## Introduction

The National Baseball Hall of Fame inducted its first eligible members in 1936.  Soon after, in 1939, the Baseball Hall of Fame Museum was opened in Cooperstown, NY.  Since its establishment, each year members of the Baseball Writer's Association of America (BBWAA) vote on eligible candidates to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.  Major League Baseball players are considered elgiible candidates if the baseball player:

* Was an active MLB player at least 15 years prior to the year of the election.
* Has been retired for at least 5 years prior to the election.
* Has played in a minimum of 10 seasons.
* Cannot be on the Baseball Hall of Fame inelligible list.  

Once a candidate is deemed eligible, multiple criteria are taken into consideration when voting occurs such as the player's record/statistics, ability, integrity, and contribution to a team.  Members of the BBWAA cast no more than 10 votes on each years ballot for the candidates of their choosing.  Any candidate that receives votes on at least 75% of the ballots will be inducted to the Hall of Fame.

**Team members:** Cale Green, Camille Goodwin, Claire Davis, Matt Martin, Silas Cobb, Trey Wehrmeyer

## Can Machine Learning be used to identify MLB Hall of Famers?

Taking into consideration the process and requirements of being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, a machine learning model will be developed and used to identify past Hall of Famers and predict future inductees.  In addition, this model will help recognize histrocially underrated players and examine the statistically-worthy players who have not yet been inducted to the Hall of Fame.  Ideally, the machine learning model will be able to be applied to future datasets and predict Hall of Fame inductees with an above average level of accuracy.

## Communication

The below methods of communication have been agreed upon by all team members and will be utilized daily and weekly to successfully complete the project:

* GitHub will house the project's repository where team members will be able to push completed work to feature branches, which will then be merged to the main accordingly.
* Zoom virtual meetings as needed outside of devoted Tuesday and Thursday evenings to further supplement collaboration and progress.
* Slack messaging to post and share a running thread of resources, ideas, and updates visible to all team members.
*  A Trello board will be utilized to better manage incomplete, in progress, and completed tasks for the project by team members.  

## Technologies

The following various technologies will be used throughout the completion of this project:

* Python and Pandas for data exploration and ETL
* PostgresSQL for a database
* Random Forest Classifier machine learning model
* Matplotlib for visualiztion of findings
* GitHub Pages, Flask, HTML, and JavaScript for dashboard creation and deployment

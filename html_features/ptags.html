        <p>The above circle chart shows the density of players elected and the density of players nominated for Hall of
            Fame induction relative to the total number of players in baseball history. This visualization puts into
            perspective the rarity of even being nominated as a potential Hall of Famer. The “bullseye” of this graph
            then illustrates the rarity within that nominee group to become fully inducted.</p>

        <p>Another visualization - this time by bar chart - that shows total number of players inducted to the HOF in
            baseball history, total number of players nominated but not inducted to the HOF, and lastly (also by far
            most commonly) all other players. This visualization helps to clarify and separate the nominees who did and
            did not get in to the HOF.</p>

        <p>This circle graph further simplifies the comparison between inducted Hall of Famers and players not inducted.

    <div class="container">
        <p>This chart illustrates the increasing rarity of which players get inducted into the HOF. As the total number
            of players has steadily increased over the past 150 years - the number of inducted players has risen at a
            much slower scale. </p>

        <p>It is showcased above that there seems to be an inverse relationshipp between years of Hall Of Fame nomination and chance of induction. Although there is a higher number of players who were nominated once, their odds of induction are low. Although players are less likely to receive multiple nominations - they seem more likely to be inducted the more nominations they receive.</p>

        <p>The above shows the number of Hall of Fame nominees versus the number of those nominees who were actually inducted. As the slope of nominees seems to increase - the slope inductees remains relatively the same. This further indicates the increased rarity of being Hall of Fame induction over time.</p>

        <p>The above circle chart shows the density of players elected and the density of players nominated for Hall of
            Fame induction relative to the total number of players in baseball history. This visualization puts into
            perspective the rarity of even being nominated as a potential Hall of Famer. The “bullseye” of this graph
            then illustrates the rarity within that nominee group to become fully inducted.</p>

        <p>Another visualization - this time by bar chart - that shows total number of players inducted to the HOF in
            baseball history, total number of players nominated but not inducted to the HOF, and lastly (also by far
            most commonly) all other players. This visualization helps to clarify and separate the nominees who did and
            did not get in to the HOF.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <p>This chart illustrates the increasing rarity of which players get inducted into the HOF. As the total number
            of players has steadily increased over the past 150 years - the number of inducted players has risen at a
            much slower scale. </p>

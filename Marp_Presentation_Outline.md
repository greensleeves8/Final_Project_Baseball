# Proposal 
## Using machine learning to predict future members to the Baseball Hall of Fame

- predict future inductees
- examine the statistically-worthy players who have not yet been inducted
- recognize historically underrated players

---
# Technologies Used

- Python and Pandas for data exploration and ETL
- PostgreSQL for a database
- Random Forest Classifier machine learning model
- Matplotlib for visualization of findings
- Heroku, Flask, HTML, and JavaScript for dashboard creation and deployment


---
# ETL
Batting ETL:


Pitching ETL:

---
# Database
Connected to postgres from ETL IPYNB. Pulled tables from postgres database to machine learning notebooks

---
# Machine Learning Model
Random Forest Classifier and Logistric Regression

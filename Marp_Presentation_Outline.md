# Idea 
Can machine learning be used to predict future baseball Hall of Famers?

Taking into consideration the process and requirements of being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, a machine learning model will be developed and used to identify past Hall of Famers and predict future inductees. In addition, this model will help recognize historically underrated players and examine the statistically-worthy players who have not yet been inducted to the Hall of Fame. Ideally, the machine learning model will be able to be applied to future datasets and predict Hall of Fame inductees with an above average level of accuracy.
